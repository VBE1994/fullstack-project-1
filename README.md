### üí≠ Reflection 

This project helped me understand how to build, style, and deploy a simple but accessible web application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
One of the key learnings was how to organize files and maintain clean separation between structure (HTML), style (CSS), and logic (JS).

I also learned how to handle form validation and accessibility features, such as ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation. Implementing input validation 
and feedback improved my understanding of user experience and accessibility standards.

Another major takeaway was deploying the app using GitHub Pages. It was the first time I configured a live project deployment directly from a GitHub 
repository, which gave me confidence in using version control and hosting tools.

Finally, I learned the importance of reflection and documentation ‚Äî writing a clear README, including screenshots and a live demo, makes a project 
professional and understandable for others. Overall, this assignment strengthened both my technical and documentation skills.
